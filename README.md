# Crosswalk for Video Annotation Data from Different Video Annotation Tools

There are a bunch of video annotation tools out there which produce video
annotation data in different schemes and formats. The reason is that many of
them were developed in a time when initiatives like W3C Open Annotation/W3C Web
Annotation did not exist or were still at an early stage. Since February 2017
the Web Annotation Data Model is an official W3C Recommendation so that it is
time to put video annotation data on a new basis.

In this repository the DARIAH-EU Working Group on Digital Annotaion and
everyone who is interested to participate will define an application profile of
the Web Annotation data model in the context of video annotation in order to
enable crosswalks for video annotation data from established video annotation
tools.
